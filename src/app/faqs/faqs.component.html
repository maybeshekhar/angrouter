            The bike is yours once you get it delivered. As you will be provided with the charger at the time of bike delivery, you can stop by the nearest charging outlet to charge your bike during longer trips.

            5. How do I charge my electric bike?
          </mat-panel-description>
        </mat-expansion-panel-header>
        <p>
            All the bikes are powered by portable lithium ion batteries. That doesn't mean that every time you have to carry the battery inside your house to juice it up. If there is an electric point in your garage then the battery can be charged by simply plugging in the other end of the charger in the onboard terminal socket available in all our bikes. Our support team will provide a thorough demonstration during the delivery.
